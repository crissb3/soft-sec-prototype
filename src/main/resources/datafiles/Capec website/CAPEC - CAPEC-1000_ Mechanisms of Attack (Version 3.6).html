More specifically, it is an aggregation of attack patterns based on effect/intent (as opposed to actions or mechanisms, such an aggregation would be a meta attack pattern). An aggregation based on effect/intent is not an actionable attack and as such is not a pattern of attack behavior.

These types of attacks assume that some piece of content or functionality is associated with an identity and that the content / functionality is trusted by the target because of this association. Often identified by the term "spoofing", these types of attacks rely on the falsification of the content and/or identity in such a way that the target will incorrectly trust the legitimacy of the content. For example, an attacker may modify a financial transaction between two parties so that the participants remain unchanged but the amount of the transaction is increased. If the recipient cannot detect the change, they may incorrectly assume the modified message originated with the original sender. Attacks of these type may involve an adversary crafting the content from scratch or capturing and modifying legitimate content.</div><div name="block_1000_156" id="block_1000_156" class="expandblock"><div class="group" id="1000_156_148"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_156_148&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_156_148" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/minus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/meta_ap.gif" alt="Meta Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Meta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

The term content spoofing is most often used to describe modification of web pages hosted by a target to display the adversary's content instead of the owner's content. However, any content can be spoofed, including the content of email messages, file transfers, or the content of other network communication protocols. Content can be modified at the source (e.g. modifying the source file for a web page) or in transit (e.g. intercepting and modifying a message between the sender and recipient). Usually, the adversary will attempt to hide the fact that the content has been modified, but in some cases, such as with web site defacement, this is not necessary. Content Spoofing can lead to malware exposure, financial fraud (if the content governs financial transactions), privacy violations, and other unwanted outcomes.</div><div name="block_1000_156_148" id="block_1000_156_148" class="expandblock"><div class="group" id="1000_156_148_145"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Checksums are used to verify message integrity. They consist of some value based on the value of the message they are protecting. Hash codes are a common checksum mechanism. Both the sender and recipient are able to compute the checksum based on the contents of the message. If the message contents change between the sender and recipient, the sender and recipient will compute different checksum values. Since the sender's checksum value is transmitted with the message, the recipient would know that a modification occurred. In checksum spoofing an adversary modifies the message body and then modifies the corresponding checksum so that the recipient's checksum calculation will match the checksum (created by the adversary) in the message.

Alternatively, an adversary may intercept a message from a legitimate sender and attempt to make it look like the message comes from them without changing its content. The latter form of this attack can be used to hijack credentials from legitimate users. Identity Spoofing attacks need not be limited to transmitted messages - any resource that is associated with an identity (for example, a file with a signature) can be the target of an attack where the adversary attempts to change the apparent identity. This attack differs from Content Spoofing attacks where the adversary does not wish to change the apparent identity of the message but instead wishes to change what the message says.

After initial contact by a web browser (or similar client), the adversary changes the IP address to which its name resolves, to an address within the target organization that is not publicly accessible. This allows the web browser to examine this internal address on behalf of the adversary. Web browsers enforce security zones based on DNS names in order to prevent cross-zone disclosure of information. Because the same name resolves to both these IP addresses, browsers will place both IP addresses in the same security zone and allow information to flow between the addresses. This allows adversaries to discover sensitive information about the internal network of an enterprise. If there is a trust relationship between the computer with the targeted browser and the internal machine the adversary identifies, additional attacks are possible. This attack differs from pharming attacks in that the adversary is the legitimate owner of the malicious DNS server and so does not need to compromise behavior of external DNS services.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_151_194_543"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Phishing and Pharming attacks often attempt to do this so that their attempts to gather sensitive information appear to come from a legitimate source. A Principal Spoof does not use stolen or spoofed authentication credentials, instead relying on the appearance and content of the message to reflect identity. The possible outcomes of a Principal Spoof mirror those of Identity Spoofing. (e.g., escalation of privilege and false attribution of data or activities) Likewise, most techniques for Identity Spoofing (crafting messages or intercepting and replaying or modifying messages) can be used for a Principal Spoof attack.

The adversary submits one CSR to be signed by a trusted certificate authority then uses the signed blob to make a second certificate appear signed by said certificate authority. Due to the hash collision, both certificates, though different, hash to the same value and so the signed blob works just as well in the second certificate. The net effect is that the adversary's second X.509 certificate, which the Certification Authority has never seen, is now signed and validated by that Certification Authority. Alternatively, the second certificate could be a signing certificate. Thus the adversary is able to start their own Certification Authority that is anchored in its root of trust in the legitimate Certification Authority that has signed the attacker's first X.509 certificate. If the original Certificate Authority was accepted by default by browsers, so will the Certificate Authority set up by the adversary and any certificates that it signs. As a result, the adversary is able to generate any SSL certificates to impersonate any web server, and the user's browser will not issue any warning to the victim. This can be used to compromise HTTPS communications and other types of systems where PKI and X.509 certificates may be used (e.g., VPN, IPSec).</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_151_473_474"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

If the leveraged algorithm confirms that a valid signature exists, it establishes a foundation of trust that is further conveyed to the end-user when interacting with a website or application. However, if the signature verification algorithm improperly validates the signature, either by not validating the signature at all or by failing to fully validate the signature, it could result in an adversary generating a spoofed signature and being classified as a legitimate entity. Successfully exploiting such a weakness could further allow the adversary to reroute users to malicious sites, steals files, activates microphones, records keystrokes and passwords, wipes disks, installs malware, and more.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_151_473_476"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Spear Phishing is an enhanced version of the Phishing attack targeted to a specific user or group. The quality of the targeted email is usually enhanced by appearing to come from a known or trusted entity. If the email account of some trusted entity has been compromised the message may be digitally signed. The message will contain information specific to the targeted users that will enhance the probability that they will follow the URL to the compromised site. For example, the message may indicate knowledge of the targets employment, residence, interests, or other information that suggests familiarity.

An application typically makes calls to functions that are a part of libraries external to the application. These libraries may be part of the operating system or they may be third party libraries. If an adversary can redirect an application's attempts to access these libraries to other libraries that the adversary supplies, the adversary will be able to force the targeted application to execute arbitrary code. This is especially dangerous if the targeted application has enhanced privileges. Access can be redirected through a number of techniques, including the use of symbolic links, search path modification, and relative path manipulation.</div><div name="block_1000_156_154_159" id="block_1000_156_154_159" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_156_154_159_132"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Modifications to the endpoint file may include appending, overwriting, corrupting, changing permissions, or other modifications. In some variants of this attack the attacker may be able to control the change to a file while in other cases they cannot. The former is especially damaging since the attacker may be able to grant themselves increased privileges or insert false information, but the latter can also be damaging as it can expose sensitive information or corrupt or destroy vital system or application files. Alternatively, the endpoint file may serve as input to the targeted application. This can be used to feed malformed input into the target or to cause the target to process different information, possibly allowing the attacker to control the actions of the target or to cause the target to expose information to the attacker. Moreover, the actions taken on the endpoint file are undertaken with the permissions of the targeted user or application, which may exceed the permissions that the attacker would normally have.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_154_159_38"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

When impersonating an expected task, the adversary monitors the task list maintained by the operating system and waits for a specific legitimate task to become active. Once the task is detected, the malicious application launches a new task in the foreground that mimics the user interface of the legitimate task. At this point, the user thinks that they are interacting with the legitimate task that they started, but instead they are interacting with the malicious application. Once the adversary's goal is reached, the malicious application can exit, leaving the original trusted application visible and the appearance that nothing out of the ordinary has occurred. A second approach entails the adversary impersonating an unexpected task, but one that may often be spawned by legitimate background processes. For example, an adversary may randomly impersonate a system credential prompt, implying that a background process requires authentication for some purpose. The user, believing they are interacting with a legitimate task, enters their credentials or authorizes the use of their stored credentials, which the adversary then leverages for nefarious purposes.

The adversary may monitor the task list maintained by the operating system and wait for a specific legitimate credential prompt to become active. Once the prompt is detected, the adversary launches a new credential prompt in the foreground that mimics the user interface of the legitimate credential prompt. At this point, the user thinks that they are interacting with the legitimate credential prompt, but instead they are interacting with the malicious credential prompt. A second approach involves the adversary impersonating an unexpected credential prompt, but one that may often be spawned by legitimate background processes. For example, an adversary may randomly impersonate a system credential prompt, implying that a background process or commonly used application (e.g., email reader) requires authentication for some purpose. The user, believing they are interacting with a legitimate credential prompt, enters their credentials which the adversary then leverages for nefarious purposes. The ultimate goal of this attack is to obtain sensitive information (e.g., credentials) from the user.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_173_506"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

The first is to leverage transparent properties that allow taps on the screen to pass through the visible application to an application running in the background. The second is to strategically place a small object (e.g., a button or text field) on top of the visible screen and make it appear to be a part of the underlying application.

A skilled adversary uses these techniques when appropriate to produce the desired outcome.

During a pretexting attack, the adversary creates an invented scenario, assuming an identity or role to persuade a targeted victim to release information or perform some action. It is more than just creating a lie; in some cases it can be creating a whole new identity and then using that identity to manipulate the receipt of information. Pretexting can also be used to impersonate people in certain jobs and roles that they never themselves have done. In simple form, these attacks can be leveraged to learn information about a target. More complicated iterations may seek to solicit a target to perform some action that assists the adversary in exploiting organizational weaknesses or obtaining access to secure facilities or systems. Pretexting is not a one-size fits all solution. Good information gathering techniques can make or break a good pretext. A solid pretext is an essential part of building trust. If an adversary’s alias, story, or identity has holes or lacks credibility or even the perception of credibility the target will most likely catch on.</div><div name="block_1000_156_416_407" id="block_1000_156_416_407" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_156_416_407_383"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The human buffer overflow methodology does not rely on over-stimulating the mind of the target, but rather embedding messages within communication that the mind of the listener assembles at a subconscious level. The human buffer-overflow method is similar to subconscious programming to the extent that messages are embedded within the message. The fundamental difference is that embedded messages have a complete semantic quality, rather than mere imagery, and the mind of the target tends to key off of particular dominant patterns. The remaining information, carefully structured, speaks directly to the subconscious with a subtle, indirect, command. The effect is to produce a pattern of thinking that the attacker has predetermined but is buried within the message and not overtly stated. Structuring a human "buffer overflow" requires precise attention to detail and the use of information in a manner that distracts the conscious mind from the message the subconscious is receiving.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_156_416_427_434"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary exploits a sample, demonstration, test, or debug interface that is unintentionally enabled on a production system, with the goal of gleaning information or leveraging functionality that would otherwise be unavailable. Non-production interfaces are insecure by default and should not be resident on production systems, since they may reveal sensitive information or functionality that should not be known to end-users. However, such interfaces may be unintentionally left enabled on a production system due to configuration errors, supply chain mismanagement, or other pre-deployment activities.
            Ultimately, failure to properly disable non-production interfaces, in a production environment, may expose a great deal of diagnostic information or functionality to an adversary, which can be utilized to further refine their attack. Moreover, many non-production interfaces do not have adequate security controls or may not have undergone rigorous testing since they were not intended for use in production environments. As such, they may contain many flaws and vulnerabilities that could allow an adversary to severely disrupt a target.

Rooting/Jailbreaking a mobile device also provides users with access to system debuggers and disassemblers, which can be leveraged to exploit applications by dumping the application's memory at runtime in order to remove or bypass signature verification methods.

In many cases this type of an attack will result in a XML Denial of Service (XDoS) due to an application becoming unstable, freezing, or crashing. XDoS is most closely associated with web services, SOAP, and Rest, because remote service requesters can post malicious XML payloads to the service provider designed to exhaust the service provider's memory, CPU, and/or disk space. The main weakness in XDoS is that the service provider generally must inspect, parse, and validate the XML messages to determine routing, workflow, security considerations, and so on. It is exactly these inspection, parsing, and validation routines that XDoS targets. This attack exploits the loosely coupled nature of web services, where the service provider has little to no control over the service requester and any messages the service requester sends.<span class="alt_terms"><span>XML Denial of Service (XML DoS)</span></span></div><div name="block_1000_210_125_528" id="block_1000_210_125_528" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_210_125_528_147"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

IP fragmentation occurs when an IP datagram is larger than the MTU of the route the datagram has to traverse. The attacker attempts to fragment the TCP packet such that the headers flag field is pushed into the second fragment which typically is not filtered. This behavior defeats some IPS and firewall filters who typically check the FLAGS in the header of the first packet since dropping this packet prevents the following fragments from being processed and assembled. Another variation is overlapping fragments thus that an innocuous first segment passes the filter and the second segment overwrites the TCP header data with the true payload which is malicious in nature. The malicious payload manipulated properly may lead to a DoS due to resource consumption or kernel crash. Additionally the fragmentation could be used in conjunction with sending fragments at a rate slightly slower than the timeout to cause a DoS condition by forcing resources that assemble the packet to wait an inordinate amount of time to complete the task. The fragmentation identification numbers could also be duplicated very easily as there are only 16 bits in IPv4 so only 65536 packets are needed.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_210_130_495"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Resource leaks most often come in the form of memory leaks where memory is allocated but never released after it has served its purpose, however, theoretically, any other resource that can be reserved can be targeted if the target fails to release the reservation when the reserved resource block is no longer needed. In this attack, the adversary determines what activity results in leaked resources and then triggers that activity on the target. Since some leaks may be small, this may require a large number of requests by the adversary. However, this attack differs from a flooding attack in that the rate of requests is generally not significant. This is because the lost resources due to the leak accumulate until the target is reset, usually by restarting it. Thus, a resource-poor adversary who would be unable to flood the target can still utilize this attack. Resource depletion through leak differs from resource depletion through allocation in that, in the former, the adversary may not be able to control the size of each leaked allocation, but instead allows the leak to accumulate until it is large enough to affect the target's performance. When depleting resources through allocation, the allocated resource may eventually be released by the target so the attack relies on making sure that the allocation size itself is prohibitive of normal operations by the target.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_210_212"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_210_212&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_210_212" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/meta_ap.gif" alt="Meta Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Meta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

An attacker gets the victim to visit their malicious page that contains a script tag whose source points to the vulnerable system with a URL that requests a response from the server containing a JSON object with possibly confidential information. The malicious page also contains malicious code to capture the JSON object returned by the server before any other processing on it can take place, typically by overriding the JavaScript function used to create new objects. This hook allows the malicious code to get access to the creation of each object and transmit the possibly sensitive contents of the captured JSON object to the attackers' server. There is nothing in the browser's security model to prevent the attackers' malicious JavaScript code (originating from attacker's domain) to set up an environment (as described above) to intercept a JSON object response (coming from the vulnerable target system's domain), read its contents and transmit to the attackers' controlled site.

Unfortunately in many cases this information is not very hard to find, especially if the attacker knows the legitimate user. These generic security questions are also re-used across many applications, thus making them even more insecure. An attacker could for instance overhear a coworker talking to a bank representative at the work place and supplying their mother's maiden name for verification purposes. An attacker can then try to log in into one of the victim's accounts, click on "forgot password" and there is a good chance that the security question there will be to provide mother's maiden name.

By carefully crafting a requests that keep the resource engaged through what is seemingly benign requests, legitimate users are limited or completely denied access to the resource. The degree to which the attack is successful depends upon the adversary's ability to sustain resource requests over time with a volume that exceeds the normal usage by legitimate users, as well as other mitigating circumstances such as the target's ability to shift load or acquire additional resources to deal with the depletion. This attack differs from a flooding attack as it is not entirely dependent upon large volumes of requests, and it differs from resource leak exposures which tend to exploit the surrounding environment needed for the resource to function.

Communication protocols are necessary to transfer messages between client and server applications. Moreover, different protocols may be used for different types of interactions. For example, an authentication protocol might be used to establish the identities of the server and client while a separate messaging protocol might be used to exchange data. If there is a weakness in a protocol used by the client and server, an attacker might take advantage of this to perform various types of attacks. For example, if the attacker is able to manipulate an authentication protocol, the attacker may be able spoof other clients or servers. If the attacker is able to manipulate a messaging protocol, the may be able to read sensitive information or modify message contents. This attack is often made easier by the fact that many clients and servers support multiple protocols to perform similar roles. For example, a server might support several different authentication protocols in order to support a wide range of clients, including legacy clients. Some of the older protocols may have vulnerabilities that allow an attacker to manipulate client-server interactions.</div><div name="block_1000_210_272_220" id="block_1000_210_272_220" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_210_272_220_105"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary leverages a firmware weakness within the Thunderbolt protocol, on a computing device to manipulate Thunderbolt controller firmware in order to exploit vulnerabilities in the implementation of authorization and verification schemes within Thunderbolt protection mechanisms. Upon gaining physical access to a target device, the adversary conducts high-level firmware manipulation of the victim Thunderbolt controller SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) flash, through the use of a SPI Programing device and an external Thunderbolt device, typically as the target device is booting up. If successful, this allows the adversary to modify memory, subvert authentication mechanisms, spoof identities and content, and extract data and memory from the target device. Currently 7 major vulnerabilities exist within Thunderbolt protocol with 9 attack vectors as noted in the Execution Flow.

It intercepts all requests originating from the client and forwards them to the correct location. The proxy also intercepts all responses to the client and forwards these to the client. All of this is done in a manner transparent to the client. Transparent proxies are often used by enterprises and ISPs. For requests originating at the client transparent proxies need to figure out the final destination of the client's data packet. Two ways are available to do that: either by looking at the layer three (network) IP address or by examining layer seven (application) HTTP header destination. A browser has same origin policy that typically prevents scripts coming from one domain initiating requests to other websites from which they did not come. To circumvent that, however, malicious Flash or an Applet that is executing in the user's browser can attempt to create a cross-domain socket connection from the client to the remote domain. The transparent proxy will examine the HTTP header of the request and direct it to the remote site thereby partially bypassing the browser's same origin policy.

For example, using a different character encoding might cause dangerous text to be treated as safe text. Alternatively, the attacker may use certain flags, such as file extensions, to make a target application believe that provided data should be handled using a certain interpreter when the data is not actually of the appropriate type. This can lead to bypassing protection mechanisms, forcing the target to use specific components for input processing, or otherwise causing the user's data to be handled differently than might otherwise be expected.

Filters may be able to catch illegal encoded strings, but may not catch doubly encoded strings. For example, a dot (.), often used in path traversal attacks and therefore often blocked by filters, could be URL encoded as %2E. However, many filters recognize this encoding and would still block the request. In a double encoding, the % in the above URL encoding would be encoded again as %25, resulting in %252E which some filters might not catch, but which could still be interpreted as a dot (.) by interpreters on the target.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_255_153_267_3"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

This attack leverages the possibility to encode potentially harmful input in UTF-8 and submit it to applications not expecting or effective at validating this encoding standard making input filtering difficult. UTF-8 (8-bit UCS/Unicode Transformation Format) is a variable-length character encoding for Unicode. Legal UTF-8 characters are one to four bytes long. However, early version of the UTF-8 specification got some entries wrong (in some cases it permitted overlong characters). UTF-8 encoders are supposed to use the "shortest possible" encoding, but naive decoders may accept encodings that are longer than necessary. According to the RFC 3629, a particularly subtle form of this attack can be carried out against a parser which performs security-critical validity checks against the UTF-8 encoded form of its input, but interprets certain illegal octet sequences as characters.</div></div></div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_262"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_262&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_262" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/minus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/category.gif" alt="Category"><span class="tip">Category - A category in CAPEC is a collection of attack patterns based on some common characteristic.

Although there are several variations to this strategy of attack, the attack methods are united in that all rely on the ability of an adversary to position and disguise malicious content such that it masquerades as a legitimate software update which is then processed by a program, undermining application integrity. As such the attack employs 'spoofing' techniques augmented by psychological or technological mechanisms to disguise the update and/or its source. Virtually all software requires frequent updates or patches, giving the adversary immense latitude when structuring the attack, as well as many targets of opportunity. Automated attacks involving malicious software updates require little to no user-directed activity and are therefore advantageous because they avoid the complex preliminary setup stages of manual attacks, which must effectively 'hook' users while avoiding countermeasures such as spam filters or web security filters.</div><div name="block_1000_262_184_186" id="block_1000_262_184_186" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_262_184_186_187"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The first weakness involves a failure to properly authenticate a server as a source of update or patch content. This type of weakness typically results from authentication mechanisms which can be defeated, allowing a hostile server to satisfy the criteria that establish a trust relationship. The second weakness is a systemic failure to validate the identity and integrity of code downloaded from a remote location, hence the inability to distinguish malicious code from a legitimate update. One predominate type of redirection attack requires DNS spoofing or hijacking of a domain name corresponding to an update server. The target software initiates an update request and the DNS request resolves the domain name of the update server to the IP address of the attacker, at which point the software accepts updates either transmitted by or pulled from the attackers' server. Attacks against DNS mechanisms comprise an initial phase of a chain of attacks that facilitate automated update hijacking attack, and such attacks have a precedent in targeted activities that have been as complex as DNS/BIND attacks of corporate infrastructures, to untargeted attacks aimed at compromising home broadband routers, as well as attacks involving the compromise of wireless access points, as well as 'evil twin' attacks coupled with DNS redirection. Due to the plethora of options open to the attacker in forcing name resolution to arbitrary servers the Automated Update Hijacking attack strategies are the tip of the spear for many multi-stage attack chains. The second weakness that is exploited by the attacker is the lack of integrity checking by the software in validating the update. Software which relies only upon domain name resolution to establish the identity of update code is particularly vulnerable, because this signals an absence of other security countermeasures that could be applied to invalidate the attackers' payload on basis of code identity, hashing, signing, encryption, and other integrity checking mechanisms. Redirection-based attack patterns work equally well against client-side software as well as local servers or daemons that provide software update functionality.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_262_184_186_533"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

These manual, or user-assisted attacks, vary from requiring the user to download and run an executable, to as streamlined as tricking the user to click a URL. Attacks which aim at penetrating a specific network infrastructure often rely upon secondary attack methods to achieve the desired impact. Spamming, for example, is a common method employed as an secondary attack vector.

ATA Security is often employed to protect hard disk information from unauthorized access. The mechanism requires the user to type in a password before the BIOS is allowed access to drive contents. Some implementations of ATA security will accept the ATA command to update the password without the user having authenticated with the BIOS. This occurs because the security mechanism assumes the user has first authenticated via the BIOS prior to sending commands to the drive. Various methods exist for exploiting this flaw, the most common being installing the ATA protected drive into a system lacking ATA security features (a.k.a. hot swapping). Once the drive is installed into the new system the BIOS can be used to reset the drive password.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_262_440_534"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_262_440_534&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_262_440_534" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Since these functions are usually intended as emergency features to return an application to a stable configuration if the current configuration degrades functionality, they may not be as strongly secured as other configuration options. The resetting of values is dangerous as it may enable undesired functionality, disable services, or modify access controls. At the very least this is a nuisance attack since the administrator will need to re-apply their configuration.

Because different file types are handled by different server processes, misclassification may force the Web server to take unexpected action, or expected actions in an unexpected sequence. This may cause the server to exhaust resources, supply debug or system data to the attacker, or bind an attacker to a remote process. This type of vulnerability has been found in many widely used servers including IIS, Lotus Domino, and Orion. The attacker's job in this case is straightforward, standard communication protocols and methods are used and are generally appended with malicious information at the tail end of an otherwise legitimate request. The attack payload varies, but it could be special characters like a period or simply appending a tag that has a special meaning for operations on the server side like .jsp for a java application server.

Normal Microsoft utilities do not show the presence of an ADS stream attached to a file. The additional space for the ADS is not recorded in the displayed file size. The additional space for ADS is accounted for in the used space on the volume. An ADS can be any type of file. ADS are copied by standard Microsoft utilities between NTFS volumes. ADS can be used by an attacker or intruder to hide tools, scripts, and data from detection by normal system utilities. Many anti-virus programs do not check for or scan ADS. Windows Vista does have a switch (-R) on the command line DIR command that will display alternate streams.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_262_165_636_35"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

There are an almost limitless number of ways an attacker can modify a technology when they are involved in its manufacture, as the attacker has potential inroads to the software composition, hardware design and assembly, firmware, or basic design mechanics. Additionally, manufacturing of key components is often outsourced with the final product assembled by the primary manufacturer. The greatest risk, however, is deliberate manipulation of design specifications to produce malicious hardware or devices. There are billions of transistors in a single integrated circuit and studies have shown that fewer than 10 transistors are required to create malicious functionality.</div><div name="block_1000_262_438" id="block_1000_262_438" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_262_438_444"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_262_438_444&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_262_438_444" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Various attacks exist against the integrity of flash memory, the most direct being rootkits coded into the BIOS or chipset of a device. Such attacks are very difficult to detect because the malicious code resides outside the filesystem or RAM, and in the underlying byte-code that drives the processor. Many devices, such as the recent attacks against digital picture frames, contain only a microprocessor and a small amount of solid-state memory, rendering these devices ideal for "flash" based malware or malicious logic. One of the pernicious characteristics of flash memory based attacks is that the malicious code can survive even a total format of the hard-drive and reinstallation of the host operating system. Virtually any device which can be integrated into a computer system is susceptible to these attacks. Additionally, any peripheral device which interfaces with the computer bus could extract or sniff confidential data, even on systems employing full-disk encryption. Trojan code placed into a video card's chipset would continue to perform its function irrespective of the host operating system, and would be invisible to all known antivirus. The threats extend to consumer products such as camcorders, digital cameras, or any consumer electronic device with an embedded microcontroller.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_262_548"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/meta_ap.gif" alt="Meta Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Meta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

The former happens when an adversary adds material to their input that is interpreted by the application causing the targeted application to perform steps unintended by the application manager or causing the application to enter an unstable state. Attacks of this type differ from Data Structure Attacks in that the latter attacks subvert the underlying structures that hold user-provided data, either pre-empting interpretation of the input (in the case of Buffer Overflows) or resulting in values that the targeted application is unable to handle correctly (in the case of Integer Overflows). In Injection attacks, the input is interpreted by the application, but the attacker has included instructions to the interpreting functions that the target application then follows.</div><div name="block_1000_152" id="block_1000_152" class="expandblock"><div class="group" id="1000_152_137"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_152_137&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_152_137" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/meta_ap.gif" alt="Meta Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Meta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Some parameter encodings use text characters as separators. For example, parameters in a HTTP GET message are encoded as name-value pairs separated by an ampersand (&amp;). If an attacker can supply text strings that are used to fill in these parameters, then they can inject special characters used in the encoding scheme to add or modify parameters. For example, if user input is fed directly into an HTTP GET request and the user provides the value "myInput&amp;new_param=myValue", then the input parameter is set to myInput, but a new parameter (new_param) is also added with a value of myValue. This can significantly change the meaning of the query that is processed by the server. Any encoding scheme where parameters are identified and separated by text characters is potentially vulnerable to this attack - the HTTP GET encoding used above is just one example.</div><div name="block_1000_152_137" id="block_1000_152_137" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_152_137_134"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_152_137_134&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_152_137_134" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Many applications allow users to send email messages by filling in fields. For example, a web site may have a link to "share this site with a friend" where the user provides the recipient's email address and the web application fills out all the other fields, such as the subject and body. In this pattern, an attacker adds header and body information to an email message by injecting additional content in an input field used to construct a header of the mail message. This attack takes advantage of the fact that RFC 822 requires that headers in a mail message be separated by a carriage return. As a result, an attacker can inject new headers or content simply by adding a delimiting carriage return and then supplying the new heading and body information. This attack will not work if the user can only supply the message body since a carriage return in the body is treated as a normal character.</div><div name="block_1000_152_137_134" id="block_1000_152_137_134" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_152_137_134_41"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Email software has become increasingly sophisticated and feature-rich. In addition, email applications are ubiquitous and connected directly to the Web making them ideal targets to launch and propagate attacks. As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known. Meta-characters are hidden from the user, but can contain scripts, enumerations, probes, and other attacks against the user's system.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_152_137_135"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_152_137_135&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_152_137_135" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

If variables that serve as URLs that the Flash application references can be controlled through parameters, then by creating a link that includes values for those parameters, an attacker can cause arbitrary content to be referenced and possibly executed by the targeted Flash application.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_152_137_6"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Mobile device users often Root/Jailbreak their devices in order to gain administrative control over the mobile operating system and/or to install third-party mobile applications that are not provided by authorized application stores (e.g. Google Play Store and Apple App Store). Adversaries may further leverage these capabilities to escalate privileges or bypass access control on legitimate applications. Although many mobile applications check if a mobile device is Rooted/Jailbroken prior to authorized use of the application, adversaries may be able to "hook" code in order to circumvent these checks.

The adversary must have the ability to inject their script into a script that is likely to be executed. If this is done, then the adversary can potentially launch a variety of probes and attacks against the web server's local environment, in many cases the so-called DMZ, back end resources the web server can communicate with, and other hosts. With the proliferation of intermediaries, such as Web App Firewalls, network devices, and even printers having JVMs and Web servers, there are many locales where an attacker can inject malicious scripts. Since this attack pattern defines scripts within scripts, there are likely privileges to execute said attack on the host.

As the user demand for new functionality in email applications grows, they become more like browsers with complex rendering and plug in routines. As more email functionality is included and abstracted from the user, this creates opportunities for attackers. Virtually all email applications do not list email header information by default, however the email header contains valuable attacker vectors for the attacker to exploit particularly if the behavior of the email client application is known.

When parsing returned CSS ignore all data that does not make sense before a valid CSS descriptor is found by the CSS parser By having control of some text in the victim's domain, the attacker is able to inject a seemingly valid CSS string. It does not matter if this CSS string is preceded by other data. The CSS parser will still locate the CSS string. If the attacker is able to control two injection points, one before the cross domain data that the attacker is interested in receiving and the other one after, the attacker can use this attack to steal all of the data in between these two CSS injection points when referencing the injected CSS while performing rendering on the site that the attacker controls. When rendering, the CSS parser will detect the valid CSS string to parse and ignore the data that "does not make sense". That data will simply be rendered.

The process starts with an adversary delivering a malicious script to a victim and convincing the victim to send the script to the vulnerable web application. The most common method of this is through a phishing email where the adversary embeds the malicious script with a URL that the victim then clicks on. In processing the subsequent request, the vulnerable web application incorrectly considers the malicious script as valid input and uses it to creates a reposnse that is then sent back to the victim. To launch a successful Reflected XSS attack, an adversary looks for places where user-input is used directly in the generation of a response. This often involves elements that are not expected to host scripts such as image tags (&lt;img&gt;), or the addition of event attibutes such as onload and onmouseover. These elements are often not subject to the same input validation, output encoding, and other content filtering and checking routines.</div><div name="block_1000_152_242_63_591" id="block_1000_152_242_63_591" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_152_242_63_591_18"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

A victim is then convinced to use the web application in a way that creates a response that includes the malicious script. This response is subsequently sent to the victim and the malicious script is executed by the victim's browser. To launch a successful Stored XSS attack, an adversary looks for places where stored input data is used in the generation of a response. This often involves elements that are not expected to host scripts such as image tags (&lt;img&gt;), or the addition of event attibutes such as onload and onmouseover.

SQL Injection results from failure of the application to appropriately validate input. When specially crafted user-controlled input consisting of SQL syntax is used without proper validation as part of SQL queries, it is possible to glean information from the database in ways not envisaged during application design. Depending upon the database and the design of the application, it may also be possible to leverage injection to have the database execute system-related commands of the attackers' choice.

Examples of secrets can include, but are not limited to, passwords, encryption keys, database lookup keys, and initial values to one-way functions. The key factor in this attack is the attackers' ability to explore the possible secret space rapidly. This, in turn, is a function of the size of the secret space and the computational power the attacker is able to bring to bear on the problem. If the attacker has modest resources and the secret space is large, the challenge facing the attacker is intractable. Assuming a finite secret space, a brute force attack will eventually succeed.

A brute force attack, if feasible computationally, will always be successful because it will essentially go through all possible passwords given the alphabet used (lower case letters, upper case letters, numbers, symbols, etc.) and the maximum length of the password. A system will be particularly vulnerable to this type of an attack if it does not have a proper enforcement mechanism in place to ensure that passwords selected by users are strong passwords that comply with an adequate password policy. In practice a pure brute force attack on passwords is rarely used, unless the password is suspected to be weak. Other password cracking methods exist that are far more effective (e.g. dictionary attacks, rainbow tables, etc.). Knowing the password policy on the system can make a brute force attack more efficient. For instance, if the policy states that all passwords must be of a certain level, there is no need to check smaller candidates.</div><div name="block_1000_223_112_49" id="block_1000_223_112_49" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_223_112_49_16"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

They then use a rainbow table of pre-computed hash chains to attempt to look up the original password. Once the original password corresponding to the hash is obtained, the attacker uses the original password to gain access to the system. A password rainbow table stores hash chains for various passwords. A password chain is computed, starting from the original password, P, via a reduce(compression) function R and a hash function H. A recurrence relation exists where Xi+1 = R(H(Xi)), X0 = P. Then the hash chain of length n for the original password P can be formed: X1, X2, X3, ... , Xn-2, Xn-1, Xn, H(Xn). P and H(Xn) are then stored together in the rainbow table. Constructing the rainbow tables takes a very long time and is computationally expensive. A separate table needs to be constructed for the various hash algorithms (e.g. SHA1, MD5, etc.). However, once a rainbow table is computed, it can be very effective in cracking the passwords that have been hashed without the use of salt.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_223_112_49_565"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            In a Password Spraying attack, an adversary tries a small list (e.g. 3-5) of common or expected passwords, often matching the target's complexity policy, against a known list of user accounts to gain valid credentials. The adversary tries a particular password for each user account, before moving onto the next password in the list. This approach assists the adversary in remaining undetected by avoiding rapid or frequent account lockouts. The adversary may then reattempt the process with additional passwords, once enough time has passed to prevent inducing a lockout. Password Spraying attacks often target management services over commonly used ports such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, LDAP, Kerberos, MySQL, and more. Additional targets include Single Sign-On (SSO) or cloud-based applications/services that utilize federated authentication protocols, and externally facing applications. Successful execution of Password Spraying attacks usually lead to lateral movement within the target, which allows the adversary to impersonate the victim or execute any action that the victim is authorized to perform. If the password chosen by the user is commonly used or easily guessed, this attack will be successful (in the absence of other mitigations). This is a specific instance of the password brute forcing attack pattern.
            Password Spraying Attacks are similar to Dictionary-based Password Attacks (CAPEC-16) in that they both leverage precompiled lists (i.e. dictionaries) of username/password combinations to try against a system/application. The primary difference is that Password Spraying Attacks leverage a known list of user accounts and only try one password for each account before moving onto the next password. In contrast, Dictionary-based Password Attacks leverage unknown username/password combinations and are often executed offline against files containing hashed credentials, where inducing an account lockout is not a concern.
            Password Spraying Attacks are also similar to Credential Stuffing attacks (CAPEC-600), since both utilize known user accounts and often attack the same targets. Credential Stuffing attacks, however, leverage known username/password combinations, whereas Password Spraying attacks have no insight into known username/password pairs. If a Password Spraying attack succeeds, it may additionally lead to Credential Stuffing attacks on different targets.

During that period of time, the adversary could replace or modify the file, causing the application to behave unexpectedly.</div><div name="block_1000_172_26_29" id="block_1000_172_26_29" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_172_26_29_27"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

If the attacker can insert malicious content in the temporary file they will be writing to the sensitive file by using the Symlink.

            The adversary modifies state information maintained by the target software or causes a state transition in hardware. If successful, the target will use this tainted state and execute in an unintended manner.
            State management is an important function within a software application. User state maintained by the application can include usernames, payment information, browsing history as well as application-specific contents such as items in a shopping cart. Manipulating user state can be employed by an adversary to elevate privilege, conduct fraudulent transactions or otherwise modify the flow of the application to derive certain benefits.
            If there is a hardware logic error in a finite state machine, the adversary can use this to put the system in an undefined state which could cause a denial of service or exposure of secure data.

In this attack, the purpose of the fuzzing is to observe the application's log and error messages, although fuzzing a target can also sometimes cause the target to enter an unstable state, causing a crash. By observing logs and error messages, the attacker can learn details about the configuration of the target application and might be able to cause the target to disclose sensitive information. In applications that return a stack trace along with the error, this can enumerate the chain of methods that led up to the point where the error was encountered. This can not only reveal the names of the methods (some of which may have known weaknesses) but possibly also the location of class files and libraries as well as parameter values.

The timing of these responses may leak important information on what is happening on the server. Browser's same origin policy prevents the attacker from directly reading the server responses (in the absence of any other weaknesses), but does not prevent the attacker from timing the responses to requests that the attacker issued cross domain. For GET requests an attacker could for instance leverage the "img" tag in conjunction with "onload() / onerror()" javascript events. For the POST requests, an attacker could leverage the "iframe" element and leverage the "onload()" event. There is nothing in the current browser security model that prevents an attacker to use these methods to time responses to the attackers' cross domain requests. The timing for these responses leaks information. For instance, if a victim has an active session with their online e-mail account, an attacker could issue search requests in the victim's mailbox. While the attacker is not able to view the responses, based on the timings of the responses, the attacker could ask yes / no questions as to the content of victim's e-mails, who the victim e-mailed, when, etc. This is but one example; There are other scenarios where an attacker could infer potentially sensitive information from cross domain requests by timing the responses while asking the right questions that leak information.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_116_54_95"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Rest applications premise is that they leverage existing infrastructure to deliver web services functionality. An example of this is a Rest application that uses HTTP Get methods and receives a HTTP response with an XML document. These Rest style web services are deployed on existing infrastructure such as Apache and IIS web servers with no SOAP stack required. Unfortunately from a security standpoint, there frequently is no interoperable identity security mechanism deployed, so Rest developers often fall back to SSL to deliver security. In large data centers, SSL is typically terminated at the edge of the network - at the firewall, load balancer, or router. Once the SSL is terminated the HTTP request is in the clear (unless developers have hashed or encrypted the values, but this is rare). The attacker can utilize a sniffer such as Wireshark to snapshot the credentials, such as username and password that are passed in the clear once SSL is terminated. Once the attacker gathers these credentials, they can submit requests to the web service provider just as authorized user do. There is not typically an authentication on the client side, beyond what is passed in the request itself so once this is compromised, then this is generally sufficient to compromise the service's authentication scheme.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_117_157_609"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

If the request is not blocked by a firewall or ACL, the target host will respond with an ICMP Type 0 Echo Reply datagram. This type of exchange is usually referred to as a 'Ping' due to the Ping utility present in almost all operating systems. Ping, as commonly implemented, allows a user to test for alive hosts, measure round-trip time, and measure the percentage of packet loss. Performing this operation for a range of hosts on the network is known as a 'Ping Sweep'. While the Ping utility is useful for small-scale host discovery, it was not designed for rapid or efficient host discovery over large network blocks. Other scanning utilities have been created that make ICMP ping sweeps easier to perform. Most networks filter ingress ICMP Type 8 messages for security reasons. Various other methods of performing ping sweeps have developed as a result. It is important to recognize the key security goal of the adversary is to discover if an IP address is alive, or has a responsive host. To this end, virtually any type of ICMP message, as defined by RFC 792 is useful. An adversary can cycle through various types of ICMP messages to determine if holes exist in the firewall configuration. When ICMP ping sweeps fail to discover hosts, other protocols can be used for the same purpose, such as TCP SYN or ACK segments, UDP datagrams sent to closed ports, etc.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_292_294"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

An Address Mask Request is an ICMP type 17 message that triggers a remote system to respond with a list of its related subnets, as well as its default gateway and broadcast address via an ICMP type 18 Address Mask Reply datagram. Gathering this type of information helps the adversary plan router-based attacks as well as denial-of-service attacks against the broadcast address. Many modern operating systems will not respond to ICMP type 17 messages for security reasons. Determining whether a system or router will respond to an ICMP Address Mask Request helps the adversary determine operating system or firmware version. Additionally, because these types of messages are rare, they are easily spotted by intrusion detection systems. Many ICMP scanning tools support IP spoofing to help conceal the origin of the actual request among a storm of similar ICMP messages. It is a common practice for border firewalls and gateways to be configured to block ingress ICMP type 17 and egress ICMP type 18 messages.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_292_295"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

This is one of several TCP 'ping' types. The RFC 793 expected behavior for a service is to respond with a RST 'reset' packet to any unsolicited ACK segment that is not part of an existing connection. So by sending an ACK segment to a port, the adversary can identify that the host is alive by looking for a RST packet. Typically, a remote server will respond with a RST regardless of whether a port is open or closed. In this way, TCP ACK pings cannot discover the state of a remote port because the behavior is the same in either case. The firewall will look up the ACK packet in its state-table and discard the segment because it does not correspond to any active connection. A TCP ACK Ping can be used to discover if a host is alive via RST response packets sent from the host.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_292_298"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

If a UDP datagram is sent to an open UDP port there is very often no response, so a typical strategy for using a UDP ping is to send the datagram to a random high port on the target. The goal is to solicit an 'ICMP port unreachable' message from the target, indicating that the host is alive. UDP pings are useful because some firewalls are not configured to block UDP datagrams sent to strange or typically unused ports, like ports in the 65K range. Additionally, while some firewalls may filter incoming ICMP, weaknesses in firewall rule-sets may allow certain types of ICMP (host unreachable, port unreachable) which are useful for UDP ping attempts.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_292_299"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Typical RFC 793 behavior specifies that when a TCP port is open, a host must respond to an incoming SYN "synchronize" packet by completing stage two of the 'three-way handshake' - by sending an SYN/ACK in response. When a port is closed, RFC 793 behavior is to respond with a RST "reset" packet. This behavior can be used to 'ping' a target to see if it is alive by sending a TCP SYN packet to a port and then looking for a RST or an ACK packet in response. Due to the different responses from open and closed ports, SYN packets can be used to determine the remote state of the port. A TCP SYN ping is also useful for discovering alive hosts protected by a stateful firewall. In cases where a specific firewall rule does not block access to a port, a SYN packet can pass through the firewall to the host and solicit a response from either an open or closed port. When a stateful firewall is present, SYN pings are preferable to ACK pings because a stateful firewall will typically drop all unsolicited ACK packets as they are not part of an existing or new connection. TCP SYN pings often fail when a stateless ACL or firewall is configured to blanket-filter incoming packets to a port. The firewall device will discard any SYN packets to a blocked port. Often, an adversary will alternate between SYN and ACK pings to discover if a host is alive.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_292_612"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Any service or application available for TCP or UDP networking will have a port open for communications over the network. Although common services have assigned port numbers, services and applications can run on arbitrary ports. Additionally, port scanning is complicated by the potential for any machine to have up to 65535 possible UDP or TCP services. The goal of port scanning is often broader than identifying open ports, but also give the adversary information concerning the firewall configuration. Depending upon the method of scanning that is used, the process can be stealthy or more obtrusive, the latter being more easily detectable due to the volume of packets involved, anomalous packet traits, or system logging. Typical port scanning activity involves sending probes to a range of ports and observing the responses. There are four port statuses that this type of attack aims to identify: open, closed, filtered, and unfiltered. For strategic purposes it is useful for an adversary to distinguish between an open port that is protected by a filter vs. a closed port that is not protected by a filter. Making these fine grained distinctions is requires certain scan types. Collecting this type of information tells the adversary which ports can be attacked directly, which must be attacked with filter evasion techniques like fragmentation, source port scans, and which ports are unprotected (i.e. not firewalled) but aren't hosting a network service. An adversary often combines various techniques in order to gain a more complete picture of the firewall filtering mechanisms in place for a host.</div><div name="block_1000_118_169_300" id="block_1000_118_169_300" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_300_287"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

SYN scanning is the most common type of port scanning that is used because of its many advantages and few drawbacks. As a result, novice attackers tend to overly rely on the SYN scan while performing system reconnaissance. As a scanning method, the primary advantages of SYN scanning are its universality and speed. RFC 793 defines the required behavior of any TCP/IP device in that an incoming connection request begins with a SYN packet, which in turn must be followed by a SYN/ACK packet from the receiving service. For this reason, like TCP Connect scanning, SYN scanning works against any TCP stack. Unlike TCP Connect scanning, it is possible to scan thousands of ports per second using this method. This type of scanning is usually referred to as 'half-open' scanning because it does not complete the three-way handshake. The scanning rate is extremely fast because no time is wasted completing the handshake or tearing down the connection. This technique allows an attacker to scan through stateful firewalls due to the common configuration that TCP SYN segments for a new connection will be allowed for almost any port. TCP SYN scanning can also immediately detect 3 of the 4 important types of port status: open, closed, and filtered.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_300_301"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The scanning process involves completing a 'three-way handshake' with a remote port, and reports the port as closed if the full handshake cannot be established. An advantage of TCP connect scanning is that it works against any TCP/IP stack. RFC 793 defines how TCP connections are established and torn down. TCP connect scanning commonly involves establishing a full connection, and then subsequently tearing it down, and therefore involves sending a significant number of packets to each port that is scanned. Compared to other types of scans, a TCP Connect scan is slow and methodical. This type of scanning causes considerable noise in system logs and can be spotted by IDS/IPS systems. TCP Connect scanning can detect when a port is open by completing the three-way handshake, but it cannot distinguish a port that is unfiltered with no service running on it from a port that is filtered by a firewall but contains an active service. Due to the significant volume of packets exchanged per port, TCP connect scanning can become very time consuming (performing a full TCP connect scan against a host can take multiple days). Generally, it is not used as a method for performing a comprehensive port scan, but is reserved for checking a short list of common ports.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_300_302"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-of-state Flag sent to an open port is discarded, whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This behavior should allow an attacker to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect closed ports via RST packets.

The purpose of this type of scan is to discover information about filter configurations rather than port state. This type of scanning is rarely useful alone, but when combined with SYN scanning, gives a more complete picture of the type of firewall rules that are present. When a TCP ACK segment is sent to a closed port, or sent out-of-sync to a listening port, the RFC 793 expected behavior is for the device to respond with a RST. Getting RSTs back in response to a ACK scan gives the attacker useful information that can be used to infer the type of firewall present. Stateful firewalls will discard out-of-sync ACK packets, leading to no response. When this occurs the port is marked as filtered. When RSTs are received in response, the ports are marked as unfiltered, as the ACK packets solicited the expected behavior from a port. When combined with SYN techniques an attacker can gain a more complete picture of which types of packets get through to a host and thereby map out its firewall rule-set. ACK scanning, when combined with SYN scanning, also allows the adversary to analyze whether a firewall is stateful or non-stateful (described in notes). TCP ACK Scans are somewhat faster and more stealthy than other types of scans but often requires rather sophisticated analysis by an experienced person. A skilled adversary may use this method to map out firewall rules, but the results of ACK scanning will be less useful to a novice.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_300_306"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Some operating systems return a positive TCP window size when a RST packet is sent from an open port, and a negative value when the RST originates from a closed port.

This type of scan can be obtained via native operating system utilities or via port scanners like nmap. When performed by a scanner, an RPC datagram is sent to a list of UDP ports and the response is recorded. Particular types of responses can be indicative of well-known RPC services running on a UDP port. Direct RPC scans that bypass portmapper/sunrpc are typically slow compare to other scan types, are easily detected by IPS/IDS systems, and can only detect open ports when an RPC service responds. ICMP diagnostic message responses can help identify closed ports, however filtered and unfiltered ports cannot be identified through TCP RPC scans. There are two general approaches to RPC scanning: One is to use a native operating system utility, or script, to query the portmapper/rpcbind application running on port 111. Portmapper will return a list of registered RPC services. Alternately, one can use a port scanner or script to scan for RPC services directly. Discovering RPC services gives the attacker potential targets to attack, as some RPC services are insecure by default.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_300_308"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

UDP scanning methods involve sending a UDP datagram to the target port and looking for evidence that the port is closed. Open UDP ports usually do not respond to UDP datagrams as there is no stateful mechanism within the protocol that requires building or establishing a session. Responses to UDP datagrams are therefore application specific and cannot be relied upon as a method of detecting an open port. UDP scanning relies heavily upon ICMP diagnostic messages in order to determine the status of a remote port. During a UDP scan, a datagram is sent to a target port. If an 'ICMP Type 3 Port unreachable' error message is returned then the port is considered closed. Different types of ICMP messages can indicate a filtered port. UDP scanning is slower than TCP scanning. The protocol characteristics of UDP make port scanning inherently more difficult than with TCP, as well as dependent upon ICMP for accurate scanning. Due to ambiguities that can arise between open ports and filtered ports, UDP scanning results often require a high degree of interpretation and further testing to refine. In general, UDP scanning results are less reliable or accurate than TCP-based scanning.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_169_309"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_118_169_309&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_118_169_309" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

The goal of this analysis to make inferences about the type of operating system or firmware that sent the error message in reply. This is useful for identifying unique characteristics of operating systems because the RFC-1122 expected behavior reads: "Every ICMP error message includes the Internet header and at least the first 8 data octets of the datagram that triggered the error; more than 8 octets MAY be sent [...]." This contrasts with RFC-792 expected behavior, which limited the quoted text to 64 bits (8 octets). Given the latitude in the specification the resulting RFC-1122 stack implementations often respond with a high degree of variability in the amount of data quoted in the error message because "older" or "legacy" stacks may comply with the RFC-792 specification, while other stacks may choose a longer format in accordance with RFC-1122.

RFC1122 specifies that the Header of the request must be echoed back when an error is sent in response, but some operating systems and firmware alter the integrity of the original header. Non-standard ICMP/IP implementations result in response that are useful for individuating remote operating system or router firmware versions. There are four general response types that can be used to distinguish operating systems apart: 1) the IP total length field may be calculated correctly, 2) an operating system may add 20 or more additional bytes to the length calculation, 3) the operating system may subtract 20 or more bytes from the correct length of the field or 4) the IP total length field is calculated with any other incorrect value. This type of behavior is useful for building a signature-base of operating system responses, particularly when error messages contain other types of information that is useful identifying specific operating system responses.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_224_312_332"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The internet identification field (ID) is typically utilized for reassembling a fragmented packet. RFC791 and RFC815 discusses about IP datagrams, fragmentation and reassembly. Some operating systems or router firmware reverse the bit order of the ID field when echoing the IP Header portion of the original datagram within the ICMP error message. There are three behaviors related to the IP ID field that can be used to distinguish remote operating systems or firmware: 1) it is echoed back identically to the bit order of the ID field in the original IP header, 2) it is echoed back, but the byte order has been reversed, or it contains an incorrect or unexpected value. Different operating systems will respond by setting the IP ID field differently within error messaging.

This type of analysis is also referred to as Reverse Code Engineering, as techniques exist for extracting source code from an executable. Several techniques are often employed for this purpose, both black box and white box. The use of computer bus analyzers and packet sniffers allows the binary to be studied at a level of interactions with its computing environment, such as a host OS, inter-process communication, and/or network communication. This type of analysis falls into the 'black box' category because it involves behavioral analysis of the software without reference to source code, object code, or protocol specifications.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_118_188_167_191"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary engages in activities to discover any sensitive constants present within the compiled code of an executable.
            These constants may include literal ASCII strings within the file itself, or possibly strings hard-coded into particular routines that can be revealed by code refactoring methods including static and dynamic analysis. One specific example of a sensitive string is a hard-coded password. Typical examples of software with hard-coded passwords include server-side executables which may check for a hard-coded password or key during a user's authentication with the server. Hard-coded passwords can also be present in client-side executables which utilize the password or key when connecting to either a remote component, such as a database server, licensing server, or otherwise, or a processes on the same host that expects a key or password. When analyzing an executable the adversary may search for the presence of such strings by analyzing the byte-code of the file itself. Example utilities for revealing strings within a file include 'strings,' 'grep,' or other variants of these programs depending upon the type of operating system used. These programs can be used to dump any ASCII or UNICODE strings contained within a program. Strings can also be searched for using a hex editors by loading the binary or object code file and utilizing native search functions such as regular expressions.
            Additionally, sensitive numeric values can occur within an executable. This can be used to discover the location of cryptographic constants.

A target system that leaks this type of information becomes the padding oracle and an adversary is able to make use of that oracle to efficiently decrypt data without knowing the decryption key by issuing on average 128*b calls to the padding oracle (where b is the number of bytes in the ciphertext block). In addition to performing decryption, an adversary is also able to produce valid ciphertexts (i.e., perform encryption) by using the padding oracle, all without knowing the encryption key. Any cryptosystem can be vulnerable to padding oracle attacks if the encrypted messages are not authenticated to ensure their validity prior to decryption, and then the information about padding error is leaked to the adversary. This attack technique may be used, for instance, to break CAPTCHA systems or decrypt/modify state information stored in client side objects (e.g., hidden fields or cookies). This attack technique is a side-channel attack on the cryptosystem that uses a data leak from an improperly implemented decryption routine to completely subvert the cryptosystem. The one bit of information that tells the adversary whether a padding error during decryption has occurred, in whatever form it comes, is sufficient for the adversary to break the cryptosystem. That bit of information can come in a form of an explicit error message about a padding error, a returned blank page, or even the server taking longer to respond (a timing attack).

During a pretexting attack, the adversary creates an invented scenario, assuming an identity or role to persuade a targeted victim to release information or perform some action. It is more than just creating a lie; in some cases it can be creating a whole new identity and then using that identity to manipulate the receipt of information. Pretexting can also be used to impersonate people in certain jobs and roles that they never themselves have done. In simple form, these attacks can be leveraged to learn information about a target. More complicated iterations may seek to solicit a target to perform some action that assists the adversary in exploiting organizational weaknesses or obtaining access to secure facilities or systems. Pretexting is not a one-size fits all solution. Good information gathering techniques can make or break a good pretext. A solid pretext is an essential part of building trust. If an adversary’s alias, story, or identity has holes or lacks credibility or even the perception of credibility the target will most likely catch on.</div><div name="block_1000_118_410_407" id="block_1000_118_410_407" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_118_410_407_383"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary guesses, obtains, or "rides" a trusted identifier (e.g. session ID, resource ID, cookie, etc.) to perform authorized actions under the guise of an authenticated user or service. Attacks leveraging trusted identifiers typically result in the adversary laterally moving within the local network, since users are often allowed to authenticate to systems/applications within the network using the same identifier. This allows the adversary to obtain sensitive data, download/install malware on the system, pose as a legitimate user for social engineering purposes, and more.
            Attacks on trusted identifiers take advantage of the fact that some software accepts user input without verifying its authenticity. Many server side processes are vulnerable to these attacks because the server to server communications have not been analyzed from a security perspective or the processes "trust" other systems because they are behind a firewall. Similarly, servers that use easy to guess or spoofable schemes for representing digital identity can also be vulnerable. Such systems frequently use schemes without cryptography and digital signatures (or with broken cryptography). Identifiers may be guessed or obtained due to insufficient randomness, poor protection (passed/stored in the clear), lack of integrity (unsigned), or improper correlation with access control policy enforcement points. Exposed configuration and properties files that contain sensitive data may additionally provide an adversary with the information needed to obtain these identifiers. An adversary may also "ride" an identifier via a malicious link, as is the case in Cross Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.
            Regardless of the attack vector, successful spoofing and impersonation of trusted credentials can lead to an adversary breaking authentication, authorization, and audit controls with the target system or application.

Session credentials allow users to identify themselves to a service after an initial authentication without needing to resend the authentication information (usually a username and password) with every message. An attacker may be able to manipulate a credential sniffed from an existing connection in order to gain access to a target server. For example, a credential in the form of a web cookie might have a field that indicates the access rights of a user. By manually tweaking this cookie, a user might be able to increase their access rights to the server. Alternately an attacker may be able to manipulate an existing credential to appear as a different user. This attack differs from falsification through prediction in that the user bases their modified credentials off existing credentials instead of using patterns detected in prior credentials to create a new credential that is accepted because it fits the pattern. As a result, an attacker may be able to impersonate other users or elevate their permissions to a targeted service.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_21_196_59"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

The adversary uses an XSS attack to have victim's browser sent an HTTP TRACE request to a destination web server, which will proceed to return a response to the victim's web browser that contains the original HTTP request in its body. Since the HTTP header of the original HTTP TRACE request had the victim's session cookie in it, that session cookie can now be picked off the HTTP TRACE response and sent to the adversary's malicious site. XST becomes relevant when direct access to the session cookie via the "document.cookie" object is disabled with the use of httpOnly attribute which ensures that the cookie can be transmitted in HTTP requests but cannot be accessed in other ways. Using SSL does not protect against XST. If the system with which the victim is interacting is susceptible to XSS, an adversary can exploit that weakness directly to get their malicious script to issue an HTTP TRACE request to the destination system's web server.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_21_593_60"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

A victim may have the social networking site open in one tab or perhaps is simply using the "remember me" feature to keep their session with the social networking site active. An attacker induces a payload to execute in the victim's browser that transparently to the victim initiates a request to the social networking site (e.g., via available social network site APIs) to retrieve identifying information about a victim. While some of this information may be public, the attacker is able to harvest this information in context and may use it for further attacks on the user (e.g., spear phishing). There are many other ways in which the attacker may get the payload to execute in the victim's browser mainly by finding a way to hide it in some reputable site that the victim visits. The attacker could also send the link to the victim in an e-mail and trick the victim into clicking on the link. This attack is basically a cross site request forgery attack with two main differences. First, there is no action that is performed on behalf of the user aside from harvesting information. So standard CSRF protection may not work in this situation. Second, what is important in this attack pattern is the nature of the data being harvested, which is identifying information that can be obtained and used in context. This real time harvesting of identifying information can be used as a prelude for launching real time targeted social engineering attacks on the victim.</div></div></div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_114"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_225_114&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_225_114" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/meta_ap.gif" alt="Meta Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Meta Attack Pattern - A meta level attack pattern in CAPEC is a decidedly abstract characterization of a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

This is usually the result of the attacker using an unexpected access procedure that does not go through the proper checkpoints where authentication should occur. For example, a web site might assume that all users will click through a given link in order to get to secure material and simply authenticate everyone that clicks the link. However, an attacker might be able to reach secured web content by explicitly entering the path to the content rather than clicking through the authentication link, thereby avoiding the check entirely.

In one such scheme the caller, when constructing a request, would concatenate all of the parameters passed to the web service with the provided authentication token and then generate a hash of the concatenated string (e.g., MD5, SHA1, etc.). That hash then forms the signature that is passed to the web service which is used on the server side to verify the origin authenticity and integrity of the message. There is a practical attack against an authentication scheme of this nature that makes use of the hash function extension / padding weakness. Leveraging this weakness, an attacker, who does not know the secret token, is able to modify the parameters passed to the web service by generating their own call and still generate a legitimate signature hash (as described in the notes). Because of the iterative design of the hash function, it is possible, from only the hash of a message and its length, to compute the hash of longer messages that start with the initial message and include the padding required for the initial message to reach a multiple of 512 bits. It is important to note that the attack not limited to MD5 and will work on other hash functions such as SHA1.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_115_480"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_225_115_480&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_225_115_480" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

            An adversary exploits improper input validation by submitting maliciously crafted input to a target application running on a server, with the goal of forcing the server to make a request either to itself, to web services running in the server’s internal network, or to external third parties. If successful, the adversary’s request will be made with the server’s privilege level, bypassing its authentication controls. This ultimately allows the adversary to access sensitive data, execute commands on the server’s network, and make external requests with the stolen identity of the server.

Services that have designated client applications (as opposed to services that use general client applications, such as IMAP or POP mail servers which can interact with any IMAP or POP client) may assume that the client will follow specific procedures. For example, servers may assume that clients will accurately compute values (such as prices), will send correctly structured messages, and will attempt to ensure efficient interactions with the server. By reverse-engineering a client and creating their own version, an adversary can take advantage of these assumptions to abuse service functionality. For example, a purchasing service might send a unit price to its client and expect the client to correctly compute the total cost of a purchase. If the adversary uses a malicious client, however, the adversary could ignore the server input and declare any total price. Likewise, an adversary could configure the client to retain network or other server resources for longer than legitimately necessary in order to degrade server performance. Even services with general clients can be susceptible to this attack if they assume certain client behaviors. However, such services generally can make fewer assumptions about the behavior of their clients in the first place and, as such, are less likely to make assumptions that an adversary can exploit.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_22_207"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_225_22_207&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_225_22_207" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Input filters prevent invalid data from being sent to an application (for example, overly large inputs that might cause a buffer overflow or other malformed inputs that may not be correctly handled by an application). Input filters might also be designed to constrained executable content. For example, if an application accepts scripting languages as input, an input filter could constrain the commands received and block those that the application's administrator deems to be overly powerful. An output filter screens responses from an application or person in order to prevent disclosure of sensitive information. For example, an application's output filter might block output that is sourced to sensitive folders or which contains certain keywords. A data mask is similar to an output filter, but usually applies to structured data, such as found in databases. Data masks elide or replace portions of the information returned from a query in order to protect against the disclosure of sensitive information. If an input filter is removed the attacker will be able to send content to the target and have the target utilize it without it being sanitized. If the content sent by the attacker is executable, the attacker may be able to execute arbitrary commands on the target. If an output filter or data masking mechanism is disabled, the target may send out sensitive information that would otherwise be elided by the filters. If the data mask is disabled, sensitive information stored in a database would be returned unaltered. This could result in the disclosure of sensitive information, such as social security numbers of payment records. This attack is usually executed as part of a larger attack series. The attacker would disable filters and would then mount additional attacks to either insert commands or data or query the target application in ways that would otherwise be prevented by the filters.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_22_207_208"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary targets the communication between two components (typically client and server), in order to alter or obtain data from transactions. A general approach entails the adversary placing themself within the communication channel between the two components. Whenever one component attempts to communicate with the other (data flow, authentication challenges, etc.), the data first flows through the adversary, who has the opportunity to observe or alter it, before being passed on to the intended recipient as if it was never observed. This interposition is transparent leaving the two compromised components unaware of the potential corruption or leakage of their communications. The potential for these attacks yields an implicit lack of trust in communication or identify between two components.
            These attacks differ from Sniffing Attacks (CAPEC-157) since these attacks often modify the communications prior to delivering it to the intended recipient.

This active adversary in the middle attack could be launched, for instance, when the victim is connected to a public WIFI hot spot. An attacker is able to intercept requests and responses between the victim's browser and some non-sensitive website that does not use TLS. When an attacker intercepts a response bound to the victim, an attacker adds an iFrame (which is possibly invisible) to the response referencing some domain with sensitive functionality and forwards the response to the victim. The victim's browser than automatically initiates an unauthorized request to the site with sensitive functionality. The same origin policy would prevent making these requests to a site other than the one from which the Java Script came, but the attacker once again uses active adversary in the middle to intercept these automatic requests and redirect them to the domain / service with sensitive functionality. Any persistent cookies that the victim has in their browser would be used for these unauthorized requests. The attacker thus actively directs the victim to a site with sensitive functionality. When the site with sensitive functionality responds back to the victim's request, an active adversary in the middle attacker intercepts these responses, injects their own malicious Java Script into these responses, and forwards to the victim's browser. In the victim's browser, that Java Script executes under the restrictions of the site with sensitive functionality and can be used to continue to interact with the sensitive site. So an attacker can execute scripts within the victim's browser on any domains the attacker desires. The attacker is able to use this technique to steal cookies from the victim's browser for whatever site the attacker wants. This applies to both persistent cookies and HTTP only cookies (unlike traditional XSS attacks). An attacker is also able to use this technique to steal authentication credentials for sites that only encrypt the login form, but do not require a secure channel for the initial request to get to the page with the login form. Further the attacker is also able to steal any autocompletion information. This attack pattern can also be used to enable session fixation and cache poisoning attacks. Additional attacks can be enabled as well.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_94_662"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

            An adversary exploits security vulnerabilities or inherent functionalities of a web browser, in order to manipulate traffic between two endpoints. This attack first requires the adversary to trick the victim into installing a Trojan Horse application on their system, such as a malicious web browser plugin, which the adversary then leverages to mount the attack. The victim interacts with a web application, such as a banking website, in a normal manner and under the assumption that the connection is secure. However, the adversary can now alter and/or reroute traffic between the client application (e.g., web browser) and the coinciding endpoint, while simultaneously displaying intended transactions and data back to the user. The adversary may also be able to glean cookies, HTTP sessions, and SSL client certificates, which can be used to pivot into an authenticated intranet. Identifying AITB is often difficult because these attacks are successful even when security mechanisms such as SSL/PKI and multifactor authentication are present, since they still function as intended during the attack.

This attack differs from privilege escalation and other privilege stealing attacks in that the adversary never actually escalates their privileges but instead is able to use a lesser degree of privilege to access resources that should be (but are not) reserved for higher privilege accounts.

This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource.

However, if the application only uses the name of the file when locating it, an attacker may be able to create a file with the same name and place it in a directory that the application will search before the directory with the legitimate file is searched. Because the attackers' file is discovered first, it would be used by the target application.

Sensitive functionality should always be protected with access controls. However configuring all but the most trivial access control systems can be very complicated and there are many opportunities for mistakes. If an attacker can learn of incorrectly configured access security settings, they may be able to exploit this in an attack. Most commonly, attackers would take advantage of controls that provided too little protection for sensitive activities in order to perform actions that should be denied to them. In some circumstances, an attacker may be able to take advantage of overly restrictive access control policies, initiating denial of services (if an application locks because it unexpectedly failed to be granted access) or causing other legitimate actions to fail due to security. The latter class of attacks, however, is usually less severe and easier to detect than attacks based on inadequate security restrictions. This attack pattern differs from CAPEC 1, "Accessing Functionality Not Properly Constrained by ACLs" in that the latter describes attacks where sensitive functionality lacks access controls, where, in this pattern, the access control is present, but incorrectly configured.</div><div name="block_1000_225_122_180" id="block_1000_225_122_180" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_225_122_180_58"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Strict interpretation of HTTP get methods means that these HTTP Get services should not be used to delete information on the server, but there is no access control mechanism to back up this logic. This means that unless the services are properly ACL'd and the application's service implementation are following these guidelines then an HTTP request can easily execute a delete or update on the server side. The attacker identifies a HTTP Get URL such as http://victimsite/updateOrder, which calls out to a program to update orders on a database or other resource. The URL is not idempotent so the request can be submitted multiple times by the attacker, additionally, the attacker may be able to exploit the URL published as a Get method that actually performs updates (instead of merely retrieving data).

This is a privilege elevation attack targeted at zone-based web-browser security. In a zone-based model, pages belong to one of a set of zones corresponding to the level of privilege assigned to that page. Pages in an untrusted zone would have a lesser level of access to the system and/or be restricted in the types of executable content it was allowed to invoke. In a cross-zone scripting attack, a page that should be assigned to a less privileged zone is granted the privileges of a more trusted zone. This can be accomplished by exploiting bugs in the browser, exploiting incorrect configuration in the zone controls, through a cross-site scripting attack that causes the attackers' content to be treated as coming from a more trusted page, or by leveraging some piece of system functionality that is accessible from both the trusted and less trusted zone. This attack differs from "Restful Privilege Escalation" in that the latter correlates to the inadequate securing of RESTful access methods (such as HTTP DELETE) on the server, while cross-zone scripting attacks the concept of security zones as implemented by a browser.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_233_234"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

A Pick Gun is a special type of lock picking instrument that works on similar principles as lock bumping. A snap gun is a hand-held device with an attached metal pick. The metal pick strikes the pins within the lock, transferring motion from the key pins to the driver pins and forcing the lock into momentary alignment. A standard lock is secured by a set of internal pins that prevent the device from turning. Spring loaded driver pins push down on the key pins. When the correct key is inserted, the ridges on the key push the key pins up and against the driver pins, causing correct alignment which allows the lock cylinder to rotate. A Snap Gun exploits this design by using a metal pin to strike all of the key pins at once, forcing the driver pins to shift into an unlocked position. Unlike bump keys or lock picks, a Snap Gun may damage the lock more easily, leaving evidence that the lock has been tampered with.</div></div></div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_390_395"><span id="script"><a href="javascript:toggleblocks(&#39;1000_225_390_395&#39;);"><img id="img_1000_225_390_395" src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/plus.gif" border="0" alt="+"></a></span><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/standard_ap.gif" alt="Standard Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Standard Attack Pattern - A standard level attack pattern in CAPEC is focused on a specific methodology or technique used in an attack.

Magstripe cards encode data on a band of iron-based magnetic particles arrayed in a stripe along a rectangular card. Most magstripe card data formats conform to ISO standards 7810, 7811, 7813, 8583, and 4909. The primary advantage of magstripe technology is ease of encoding and portability, but this also renders magnetic strip cards susceptible to unauthorized duplication. If magstripe cards are used for access control, all an attacker need do is obtain a valid card long enough to make a copy of the card and then return the card to its location (i.e. a co-worker's desk). Magstripe reader/writers are widely available as well as software for analyzing data encoded on the cards. By swiping a valid card, it becomes trivial to make any number of duplicates that function as the original.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_390_395_398"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Often, magnetic strip encoding methods follow a common format for a given system laid out in up to three tracks. A single card may allow access to a corporate office complex shared by multiple companies. By analyzing how the data is stored on a card, it is also possible to create valid cards via brute-force attacks. For example, a single card can grant access to a building, a floor, and a suite number. Reading and analyzing data on multiple cards, then performing a difference analysis between data encoded on three different cards, can reveal clues as to how to generate valid cards that grant access to restricted areas of a building or suites/rooms within that building. Data stored on magstripe cards is often unencrypted, therefore comparing which data changes when two or more cards are analyzed can yield results that aid in determining the structure of the card data. A trivial example would be a common system data format on a data track which binary encodes the suite number of a building that a card will open. By creating multiple cards with differing binary encoded segments it becomes possible to enter unauthorized areas or pass through checkpoints giving the electronic ID of other persons.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_390_395_399"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

In some cases RFID chips are used for building access control, employee identification, or as markers on products being delivered along a supply chain. Some organizations also embed RFID tags inside computer assets to trigger alarms if they are removed from particular rooms, zones, or buildings. Similar to Magnetic strip cards, RFID cards are susceptible to duplication (cloning) and reuse. RFID (Radio Frequency Identification) are passive devices which consist of an integrated circuit for processing RF signals and an antenna. RFID devices are passive in that they lack an on on-board power source. The majority of RFID chips operate on either the 13.56 MHz or 135 KHz frequency. The chip is powered when a signal is received by the antenna on the chip, powering the chip long enough to send a reply message. An attacker is able to capture and analyze RFID data by either stimulating the chip to respond or being proximate to the chip when it sends a response to a remote transmitter. This allows the attacker to duplicate the signal and conduct attacks such as gaining unauthorized access to a building or impersonating a user's identification.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_390_395_400"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

RFID tags are used primarily for access control, inventory, or anti-theft devices. The purpose of attacking the RFID chip is to disable or damage the chip without causing damage to the object housing it. When correctly performed the RFID chip can be disabled or destroyed without visible damage or marking to whatever item or device containing the chip. Attacking the chip directly allows for the security device or method to be bypassed without directly damaging the device itself, such as an alarm system or computer system Various methods exist for damaging or deactivating RFID tags. For example, most common RFID chips can be permanently destroyed by creating a small electromagnetic pulse near the chip itself. One method employed requires the modifying a disposable camera by disconnecting the flash bulb and soldering a copper coil to the capacitor. Firing the camera in this configuration near any RFID chip-based device creates an EMP pulse sufficient to destroy the chip without leaving evidence of tampering. So far this attack has been demonstrated to work against RFID chips in the 13.56 MHz range.</div></div><div class="group" id="1000_225_390_395_626"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

            An adversary guesses or obtains (i.e. steals or purchases) legitimate credentials (e.g. userID/password) to achieve authentication and to perform authorized actions under the guise of an authenticated user or service. Attacks leveraging trusted credentials typically result in the adversary laterally moving within the local network, since users are often allowed to login to systems/applications within the network using the same password. This further allows the adversary to obtain sensitive data, download/install malware on the system, pose as a legitimate user for social engineering purposes, and more.
            Attacks on known passwords generally rely on the primary fact that users often reuse the same username/password combination for a variety of systems, applications, and services, coupled with poor password policies on the target system or application. Adversaries can also utilize known passwords to target Single Sign On (SSO) or cloud-based applications and services, which often don't verify the authenticity of the user's input. Known credentials are usually obtained by an adversary via a system/application breach and/or by purchasing dumps of credentials on the dark web. These credentials may be further gleaned via exposed configuration and properties files that contain system passwords, database connection strings, and other sensitive data.
            Successful spoofing and impersonation of trusted credentials can lead to an adversary breaking authentication, authorization, and audit controls with the target system or application.

            An adversary tries known username/password combinations against different systems, applications, or services to gain additional authenticated access. Credential Stuffing attacks rely upon the fact that many users leverage the same username/password combination for multiple systems, applications, and services. Attacks of this kind often target management services over commonly used ports such as SSH, FTP, Telnet, LDAP, Kerberos, MySQL, and more. Additional targets include Single Sign-On (SSO) or cloud-based applications/services that utilize federated authentication protocols, and externally facing applications. The primary goal of Credential Stuffing is to achieve lateral movement and gain authenticated access to additional systems, applications, and/or services. A successfully executed Credential Stuffing attack could result in the adversary impersonating the victim or executing any action that the victim is authorized to perform. If the password obtained by the adversary is used for multiple systems, accounts, and/or services, this attack will be successful (in the absence of other mitigations).
            Although not technically a brute force attack, Credential Stuffing attacks can function as such if an adversary possess multiple known passwords for the same user account. This may occur in the event where an adversary obtains user credentials from multiple sources or if the adversary obtains a user's password history for an account.
            Credential Stuffing attacks are similar to Password Spraying attacks (CAPEC-565) regarding their targets and their overall goals. However, Password Spraying attacks do not have any insight into known username/password combinations and instead leverage common or expected passwords. This also means that Password Spraying attacks must avoid inducing account lockouts, which is generally not a worry of Credential Stuffing attacks. Password Spraying attacks may additionally lead to Credential Stuffing attacks, once a successful username/password combination is discovered.

Kerberos is the default authentication method for Windows domains and is utilized for numerous authentication purposes. Attacks leveraging trusted Kerberos credentials can result in numerous consequences, depending on what Kerberos credential is stolen. For example, Kerberos service accounts are typically used to run services or scheduled tasks pertaining to authentication. However, these credentials are often weak and never expire, in addition to possessing local or domain administrator privileges. If an adversary is able to acquire these credentials, it could result in lateral movement within the Windows domain or access to any resources the service account is privileged to access, among other things. Kerberos credentials can be obtained by an adversary via methods such as system breaches, network sniffing attacks, and/or brute force attacks against the Kerberos service account or the hash of a service ticket. Ultimately, successful spoofing and impersonation of trusted Kerberos credentials can lead to an adversary breaking authentication, authorization, and audit controls with the target system or application.</div><div name="block_1000_225_560_652" id="block_1000_225_560_652" class="collapseblock"><div class="group" id="1000_225_560_652_509"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/bullet.gif" border="0" alt="*"><span class="graph_title"><span style="margin-left:3px; margin-right:3px" class="right"><span class="tool"><img src="./CAPEC - CAPEC-1000_ Mechanisms of Attack (Version 3.6)_files/detailed_ap.gif" alt="Detailed Attack Pattern"><span class="tip">Detailed Attack Pattern - A detailed level attack pattern in CAPEC provides a low level of detail, typically leveraging a specific technique and targeting a specific technology, and expresses a complete execution flow.

Attacks leveraging trusted Windows credentials typically result in the adversary laterally moving within the local Windows network, since users are often allowed to login to systems/applications within the domain using their Windows domain password. This domain authentication can occur directly (user typing in their password or PIN) or via Single Sign-On (SSO) or cloud-based authentication, which often don't verify the authenticity of the user's input. Known credentials are usually obtained by an adversary via a system/application breach and/or by purchasing dumps of credentials on the dark web.
